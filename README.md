# RadioFM
Thank you for downloading RadioFM for Unity 3d! Please visit the Ghostdog Studio Discord to access support channels.

The Radio FM system simulates a real-world radio experience. Players can toggle the radio
on and off, switch between radio stations, and play songs. It manages the playback of
songs from different radio stations, randomly selecting tracks and updating the UI with
track titles and station names. The RadioLED and RadioDisplay components provide visual
feedback to indicate the status of the radio, whether it's on or off. The AudioSource
handles the playback of audio clips, while the AudioClip represents the songs available on
each radio station.
